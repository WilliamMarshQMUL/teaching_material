    "## Filtering numbers\n",
    "A similar pattern of loop containing an if statement is used to filter based on numbers (possibly based on caluclated values rather than input ones). A common example of this pattern of code is to need to  do something different every 3 (say) numbers. This is equivalent to asking if a number is divisible by a given number (here divisible by 3). A simple way to test this is to check the remainder when you do a division. This is given by the **modulus** operator % If  (n % 3) is 0 then the n is divisible by 3. Modulus acts as a clock-like counter resetting to 0\n",
    "So \n",
    "```\n",
    "(0 % 3) = 0\n",
    "(1 % 3) = 1\n",
    "(2 % 3) = 2\n",
    "(3 % 3) = 0\n",
    "(4 % 3) = 1\n",
    "(5 % 3) = 2\n",
    "(6 % 3) = 0\n",
    "etc\n",
    "```\n",
    "0 3 and 6 are\n",
    "So if you want to do something different every 10 times round a loop, then use a test based on the modulys"

If it is not then no newline is printed and instead a tab character is printed. This means the numbers are split by tabs but\n",
