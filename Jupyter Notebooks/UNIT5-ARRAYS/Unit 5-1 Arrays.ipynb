    "We often need to store and manipulate bulk data of the same type (such as the names of all the players in a tennis tournament). That is what arrays are for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are a way to store lots of values, instead of just one, in a single variable. All the values must be **of the same type**. You can think of a variable of type array as having lots of separate compartments, like a cabinet full of lots of identically sized drawers, with one thing stored in each drawer. \n",
    "\n",
    "A program can get at all values using the single variable name. The separate values are referred to by a number which gives the position or **index** of where it can be found. So it is as though each drawer of the cabinet has a number labelling it. To get at a particular drawer you give the cabinet's name and the number of the drawer.\n",

So for an array a, a[0] is position 0, a[1] is position 1. You can think of these as similar to individual variables. You can print values stored in an array or assign new values in particular positions in this way. For example,\n",
