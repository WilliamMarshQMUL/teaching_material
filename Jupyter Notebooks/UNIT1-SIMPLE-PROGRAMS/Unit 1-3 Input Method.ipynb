    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "The code first prints a question about Christopher Nolan. It then waits for the user to type in an answer before echoing the answer back.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by first calling a method askAboutFilm. This method first declares a String variable called film and creates a scanner which links to the keyboard to get input. It prints a message asking a question and then gets the next Line (up to ENTER being pressed) from the keyboard via the scanner.. The sequence of characters typed is formed into a String and stored in variable film. It then prints a message echoing back what was tyoed by constructing a new String that concatenates (sticks together) the strings \"So you think it was \", whatever is stored in film and \" do you?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It then ends the method returning back to the call point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two differences in the method definition. First in the header line of the method the type String is given\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static String inputFilm ()\n",
    "```\n",
    "instead of **void** in the original.\n",
    "Then the return statement is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    " return film;\n",
    "```\n",
    "insterad of just\n",
    "```java\n",
    " return;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Both indicate that a String is returned by the method as its result - whatever string is held in variable film when the return command is executed is passed back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call to the method is also different. It is now on the right hand side (rhs) of an assignment.\n",
    "```java\n",
    "film_input = inputFilm();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Its job is to provide the string that will then be stored in the variable called film_input, hence the need to return a value.\n",
