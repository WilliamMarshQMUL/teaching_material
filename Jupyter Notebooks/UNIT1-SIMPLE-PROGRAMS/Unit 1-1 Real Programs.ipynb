    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### More on Comments\n",
    "In fact most of the rest are just **comments** : messages to human readers of the program. There are two ways of writing comments:\n",

    "// This is a comment that lasts to the end of the line only\n",
    "```\n",
    "We are using a new kind of comment\n",

    "*/\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the second kind of comment you use ```/*``` to show where it starts and ```*/``` to show where it ends. Everything in between is just for a human reader.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first kind of comment is normally used for short notes to help a reader understand some simple aspect. This second kind is to write more detailed explanations. The extra ```*``` characters just help separate different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most important thing to notice now is that in the real Java program, their are 2 procedures. Can you find the other one and work out what it's name is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our call to the helloMessage call is now inside a procedure! All instructions in your programs should be inside a procedure. The one that the call to helloMessage is inside is called main. All your Java programs MUST have a method called Main. It is the place where the program starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, do not worry too much about exactly what the details are for now. Focus on the parts that do all the work - the parts you have been experimenting with so far. Change those parts in the program and you can make it do print any message you want.\n",

    "- A program consists of commands to be followed in a specific order.\n",
    "    - These commands are grouped into procedures (which are also known as methods)\n",
    "- The command to print a message to the screen is System.out.println\n",
    "    - it is just a procedure that is already defined for you to use\n",
    "    - Place the message to be printed in quotes inside the () of the call of System.out.println\n",
    "    - After printing the message the program moves onto a next line ready to print the next thing.\n",
    "- The command to ask a question of the user (input) is scanner.nextLine();\n",
    "    - the value that the user types is stored in a variable\n",
    "    - a variable is just a named storage place\n",
    "    - Once something is stored in a variable, you can get the value back using the name of the variable\n",
    "- A program is made up of lots of procedure definitions.\n",
    "    - Procedure definitions attach a name to a procedure body (the actual instructions)\n",
    "    - They are a bit like individual recipes\n",
    "    - The name is used to call the procedure (ie follow the instructions in the body)\n",
    "    - Procedure definitions end with a return statement (it sends the program back to where it was called from)\n",
    "- Procedures only do something when they are called.\n",
    "    - A procedure is called by giving its name followed by open and close brackets ().\n",
    "    - When a procedure is called the instructions in its body are executed in the order written.\n",
    "    - A procedure is a kind of method.\n",
    "    - When you call a method, you jump to the code in the body, execute it then jump back to where you were and carry on with the next command from there.\n",
    "    - you can call other procedures you have defined inside a procedure.\n",
    "- All programs should include comments\n",
    "    - Comments are just explanations of what parts of the program do to help a human understand them\n",
