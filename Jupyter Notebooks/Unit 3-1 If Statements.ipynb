    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "It prints\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's get started\n",
    "It was yes!\n",
    "Now we have finished.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because the variable holds exactly the String \"yes\" it executes the first branch of the if statement, ignoring the second. \"Let's get started\" is printed before the if statement is executed. Then it prints \"It was Yes!\" Then it jumps beyond the if statement to print \"Now we have finished.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "This time it prints\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's get started\n",
    "It was NOT yes!\n",
    "Now we have finished.\n",
    "```\n",
    "It prints the same things before and after the if statement as before, but this time the test is false so it ignores the first branch of the if statement and executes the second (Ie \"It wasn't yes!\" instead before carrying on with the print statement after the if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3\n",
    "If you change the code to anything else other than exactly \"yes\" then the second branch of code is executed. It prints\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's get started\n",
    "It was NOT yes!\n",
    "Now we have finished.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The test of the if statement is for \"yes\". Only if the variable holds that exactly does it execute the first branch. Capital letters are different. Adding a space in too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4\n",
    "When both city variables hold the same thing, the test is true (city1 IS equal to city2) so the first branch is executed and so\n",
    "```\n",
    "They are the same\n",
    "```\n",
    "is printed. If the two cities are at all different then the test is false (city1 IS NOT equal to city2) so the second branch is executed and \n",
