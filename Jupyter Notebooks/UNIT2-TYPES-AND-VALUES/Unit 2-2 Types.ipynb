    "## Why Types\n",
    "Variables have types in Java. Types collect values into groups that have the same properties such as being numbers or text or a true/false value. Each is stored in a different way (using a different representation).\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong type system where variables have types is important as it helps\n",
    "\n",
    "- tell the compiler what values you (the programmer) intend so put in it so can catch your mistakes\n",
    "    - eg if you said a variable was to hold a number then put a word in it you are confused and it can tell you\n",
    "    \n",
    "- allow it to allocate the right space to store the values \n",
    "    - eg a string needs more space than an integer\n",
    "    \n",
    "- tell the compiler what operations make sense so it can catch your mistakes\n",
    "    - eg if you said a variable was to hold a string but then try to multiply with it you are confused and it can tell you\n",
