    "```\n",
    "A sequence of instructions are followed one at a time in the order given. The variable called colour initially holds string \"BLUE\" and that is the last thing stored in it before the first print statement so that is  what is printed by the first print statement when it is its turn to execute. Then however a new value, PURPLE, is put into the variable colour (losing the old value), so the second time the print statement is executed, it is PURPLE that it finds in colour and so prints.\n",
