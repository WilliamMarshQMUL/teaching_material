    "\n",
    "Before you can use a new record type you have to define the record - give it a name (what are you going to call the type) and say what its component types are (what one is made up of) and give each part a name (the field name)."

    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String albatross_name = \"Wandering Albatross\";\n",
    "int albatross_wing_span = 305;\n",

    "System.out.println(\"and has a wing span of \" + kite_wing_span + \"cm.\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing visible happens when you run it, but behind the scenes it has created a new type called Bird. This means the program can use that type just as it uses other types like int or String to declare variables of the type. It has in effect stored a template or blueprint of what a value of type Bird is like - it consists of a String and two ints package together into a single value. The string is refered to as 'name', and the integeers as 'length' and 'wing_span'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3\n",
    "It creates a new variable of type Bird called albatross.\n",

    "### Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "It first stores the string \"Wandering Albatross\" in the name field of variable albatross (ie in albatross.name).\n",
    "It then stores the integer 305 into the field wing_span and then 135 into the field length of variable albatross.\n",
    "\n",
    "FInally it prints out the details, pulling out the name, length and wing span when needed (using eg albatross.name to get the value stored in the name field) combining them into a string sentence printed about the Albatross based on the information stored.\n",

    "The code as a whole first calls method birdDetails. It creates a new bird record to hold data about the albatross and then stores the relevant facts (name, wing-span, length and colour) by assigning directly to the fields. It then calls the method printBirdDetails to print all the details known in sentences. It is passed the whole record which it locally refers to as b (because it could be passed any record so each record it is passed will have a different nam, whatever it is passed it locally renames it and then refers to the record by that name). It pulls out the values from each individual field when needed to insert into the sentences printed. It then returns back to method birdDetails which immediately finishes itself.\n",
